Tomorrow TODO: 
(1) School Records: I'm thinking about generating a few more example csv and xlsx files(one for each subject with test results from each quarter, and more creative and irrelavant ones) to illustrate "dynamics" of our agent, i.e. can choose select files flexibly based on query, and include trend as a parameter in analysing academic performance
(2) finish 3rd agent(combine text outputs of 2 existing agents)
