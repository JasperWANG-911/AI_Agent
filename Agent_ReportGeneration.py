2. A detailed school records performance analysis

Key requirements for the feedback:
- Be constructive and supportive
- Provide specific, actionable insights
- Balance both classroom behavior and academic performance
- Highlight strengths and areas for improvement
- Use a tone appropriate for parents and educators
- Maintain student privacy and use a sensitive approach
- Avoid overly technical language
- Suggest personalized strategies for student development

- Current academic performance
- Classroom engagement and behavior
- Potential learning strategies
- Areas of strength
